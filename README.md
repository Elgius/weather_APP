# weather_APP
## Rough summary on how this app works:

weather app basically opens up a small GUI screen that shows you the weather data based on your input

its is to be noted that we will be using the OpenWeather API and have limited callbacks. i am not disclosing API key, but if you are to use this program, please create a seperate file or enter your API key into the respective fields on the main program file

it is also to be noted that the program creates a json file and filters it to to display key information on the weather. Does that mean this app works? yes, but that also means you need to know how json files work. The program makes json files easier to read as it converts the file into a python dictionary, Making data manipulation easier

gui.py is the working model as of this Readme update
