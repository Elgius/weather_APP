# weather_APP
## Rough summary on how this app works:

weather app basically that runs on command line

its is to be noted that we will be using the OpenWeather API and have limited callbacks. i am not disclosing API key, but if you are to use this program, please create a seperate file or enter your API key into the respective fields on the main program file

it is also to be noted that the program creates a json file and filters it to to display key information on the weather. Does that mean this app works? yes, but that also means normal people who are not used to python dictionaries or json files will have a hard time to decipher what the data is
