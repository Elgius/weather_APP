# weather_APP
 weather app basically that runs on command line

its is to be noted that we will be using the OpenWeather API and have limited callbacks. i am not disclosing API key, but if you are to use this program, please create a seperate file or enter your API key into the respective fields on the main program file

it is also to be noted that the program creates a json file and uses fill up a F string to give details of the weather

not, there is no GUI as of yet, probably coming soon
